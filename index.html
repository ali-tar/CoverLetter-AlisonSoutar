          <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            Although I have experience in practical implementation, I have an in-depth understanding of commonly used 
            design systems, methodologies and practices. I can adapt to new concepts quickly, and am familiar with architecture 
            patterns, multi-layer architecture, agile development, and concurrent and parallel programming - to name a few.

          </div>
          <h2>Backend development</h2>
          <p>
            I have three years of undergraduate experience with backend development principles, design and execution. 
            I aim to create code that is highly efficient and easy to read. I religiously follow coding best practices, 
            constantly refining and refactoring existing code ensuring it is readable, useful and reusable.

          </div>
          <h2>Frontend development</h2>
          <p>
            I have a thorough understanding of basic front-end coding principles and practice. I am well-versed in good design practice.
            My websites are goal-oriented, and drive users towards completing a desired action. I am constantly ensuring my websites 
            are fully functional and user-friendly.

          </div>
          <h2>User experience and interface design</h2>
          <p>
            I am proficient in analysing human behaviour and solving problems in a unique way with practical and strategic design skills. 
            I can take a project from the conceptual stage into interactive prototyping and further into a working front-end final version. 
            Designs are ergonomic and straightforward - while remaining inspiring and refreshing.

              One of the companies we worked with was MakeReign. I enjoyed the logical feedback and briefing sessions with the MakeReign 
              team and applied as an intern during my studies. Recognising me for my work on their live brief, they accepted my application.
              MakeReign is a prototyping and user experience design agency. I spent the majority of my internship sitting in on client briefs

              I picked up a part-time bartending job for some extra income whilst applying for full-time positions and learning new skills.
              Although not directly translatable to the development and design industry, it has taught me how to operate quickly and
              efficiently under immense pressure. Additionally, I have greatly improved my people skills. I can communicate clearly
              and concisely with my co-workers, in addition to being attentive to a customer's needs. Additionally, it has taught me how to
              listen closely to what a client wants to be able to deliver a satisfying product.

              attending the course for the following year. In being a tutor, I was able to learn how others view problems and the
              best ways to explain possible solutions and outcomes to different people. Additionally, this allowed me to grapple 
              with the content from an entirely new perspective - further solidifying my knowledge gained during this year of study.
