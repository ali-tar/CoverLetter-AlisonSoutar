            After completing my advanced diploma in User Centered Design (UX/UI), I was offered a tutoring position for students attending the course for the following year. In being a tutor, I was able to learn how others view problems and the best ways to explain possible solutions and outcomes to different people. Additionally, this allowed me to grapple with the content from an entirely new perspective - further solidifying my knowledge gained during this year of study.

            I have engaged with learner’s assessments thoroughly and thoughtfully to provide insightful feedback allowing them to hone their own UX/UI design skills whilst routinely testing and reinforcing my own knowledge. 

            Helping students understand a wide variety of topics over a number of different courses, including topics such as the fundamentals of project management, web design, and user experience / user interface considerations.

            Although I have experience in practical implementation, I have an in-depth understanding of commonly used 
            design systems, methodologies and practices. I can adapt to new concepts quickly, and am familiar with architecture

          <h2>Backend development</h2>
          <p>
            I have three years of undergraduate experience with backend development principles, design and execution. 
            I aim to create code that is highly efficient and easy to read. I religiously follow coding best practices, 
            constantly refining and refactoring existing code ensuring it is readable, useful and reusable.

          <h2>Frontend development</h2>
          <p>
            I have a thorough understanding of basic front-end coding principles and practice. I am well-versed in good design practice.
            My websites are goal-oriented, and drive users towards completing a desired action. I am constantly ensuring my websites 
            are fully functional and user-friendly.

          </div>
          <h2>User experience and interface design</h2>
          <p>
            I am proficient in analysing human behaviour and solving problems in a unique way with practical and strategic design skills. 
            I can take a project from the conceptual stage into interactive prototyping and further into a working front-end final version. 
            Designs are ergonomic and straightforward - while remaining inspiring and refreshing.
